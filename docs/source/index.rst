Welcome to the AnsibleMetrics documentation!
============================================



**AnsibleMetrics** is a Python-based static source code measurement tool to characterize Infrastructure-as-Code.
It helps quantify the characteristics of infrastructure code to support DevOps engineers when maintaining and evolving it.
It currently supports 46 source code metrics, though other metrics can be derived by combining the implemented ones.
